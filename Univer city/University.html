    <h1>University System </h1>
    </center>
    <p>The higher education system in India includes both private and public universities. Public universities are supported by the Government of India and the state governments, while private universities are mostly supported by various bodies and societies. Universities in India are recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956.[1] In addition, 16 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination.[2] The types of universities controlled by the UGC include Central universities,[3][4] State universities,[5] Deemed universities[6] and Private universities.

        In addition to the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees, and while not called "university" by name, act as such. They usually fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education. In official documents they are called "autonomous bodies","university-level institutions", or even simply "other central institutions". Such institutes include:
        <ul>
       <li> Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are a group of autonomous engineering, science, and management institutes with special funding and administration. The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 lists twenty three IITs.

        <li>National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are a group of engineering, science, technology and management institutes with special funding and administration. They were established as "Regional Engineering Colleges" and upgraded in 2003 to national status and central funding. The latest act governing NITs is the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007 which declared them Institutes of National Importance. It lists thirty one NITs.

        <li>Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are a group of business schools created by the Government of India. IIMs are registered Societies governed by their respective Board of Governors. The Department of Higher Education lists 19 IIMs.

        <li>Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) are a group of autonomous information technology oriented institutes with special funding and administration. The Indian Institutes of Information Technology Act[14] lists five central and twenty public-private partnership IIITs.

        <li> Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPAs) are a group of architecture and planning schools established by Ministry of HRD, Government of India. All the SPAs are premier centrally funded institution.

        <li>Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) are a group of seven premier institutes established by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, devoted to science education and research in basic sciences. They are broadly set on the lines of the Indian Institute of Science.
       </ul>
        All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) are a group of autonomous public medical colleges of higher education. As of 2020, these are 15 in number and are established by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
        National Law Universities (NLU) are law schools established for the promotion of legal education and research. As of 2020, there are 22 NLUs in India regulated by the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Bar Council of India.
        Institutes of National Importance (INIs) are institutions which are set by an act of parliament. They receive special recognition and funding. The Department of Higher Education's list includes 95 institutions including all of AIIMSs, IITs, NITs, SPAs, IIITs and some others like NIMHANS,IISc, ISI etc. were also legally awarded the status.
        Institute under State Legislature Act (IuSLAs) are autonomous higher education institutes established or incorporated by a State legislature Act. Institutes that are 'under State Legislature Act' enjoy academic status and privileges like State universities.</p>

        <p>The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are central government owned public technical institutes located across India. They are under the ownership of Ministry of Education, Government of India. They are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, which has declared them as Institutes of National Importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance as the country's premier institutions in the field of Technology.[2][3] The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 currently lists twenty-three IITs.[4] Each IIT is autonomous, linked to the others through a common council (IIT Council), which oversees their administration. The Minister of Education, India is the ex officio Chairperson of the IIT Council.
         </p>

         <p>The history of the IIT system nearly dates back to 1946 when Sir Jogendra Singh of the Viceroy's Executive Council set up a committee whose task was to consider the creation of Higher Technical Institutions for post-war industrial development in India. The 22-member committee, headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, recommended the establishment of these institutions in various parts of India, along the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with affiliated secondary institutions.<br>

            The first Indian Institute of Technology was founded in May 1950 at the site of the Hijli Detention Camp in Kharagpur, West Bengal.[17] The name "Indian Institute of Technology" was adopted before the formal inauguration of the institute on 18 August 1951 by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.[18] On 15 September 1956, the Parliament of India passed the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act, declaring it as an Institute of National Importance. Jawaharlal Nehru, first Prime Minister of India, in the first convocation address of IIT Kharagpur in 1956

        <p>The National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are the central government-owned-public technical institutes under the ownership of Ministry of Education, Government of India. They are governed by the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research Act, 2007, which declared them as institutions of national importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance. The act lists thirty-one NITs.[2] Each NIT is autonomous, linked to the others through a common council known as the Council of NITSER, which oversees their administration and all NITs are funded by the Government of India.[3]

            In 2020, National Institutional Ranking Framework ranked twenty four NITs in the top 200 in engineering category.[4] The language of instruction is English at all these institutes. As of 2022, the total number of seats for undergraduate programs is 23,997 and for postgraduate programs 13,664 in all the 31 NITs put together
        </p>

        <p>During the second five-year plan (1956â€“60) in India, a number of industrial projects were contemplated. The Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) were established by the central government to mimic the IITs at a regional level and act as benchmarks for the other colleges in that state. The admission used to be highly selective. Students topping the respective state's 12th board exam could be admitted at the REC of their state. Thus, 17 RECs were established from 1959 onwards in each of the major states. Each college was a joint and cooperative enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government.
        Later on, 6 more were added by 1967. The early 15 institutes were Srinagar, Warangal, Calicut, Durgapur, Kurukshetra, Jamshedpur, Jaipur, Nagpur, Rourkela, Surathkal, Surat, Tiruchirappalli, Bhopal, Allahabad, and Silchar. It established 2 more, one in Hamirpur in 1986, and another in Jalandhar in 1987.

        These were large-sized institutions judged by the standards then prevailing in the country. The considerations that weighed in this decision were:

        A large-sized college would be more efficient than the equivalent small colleges, the proposed colleges have to meet the additional requirements  of the country as a whole and for that purpose should have to function on an all-India basis. Therefore, the smaller they are in number and the larger in size, the better, and for the same reason their location is important from an all-India point of view.
        <br>
         The RECs were jointly operated by the central government and the concerned state government. Non-recurring expenditures and expenditures for post-graduate courses during the REC period were borne by the central government while recurring expenditure on undergraduate courses was shared equally by central and state governments. They were considered to be the best government engineering colleges after the IITs in India even before their upgrade to National Institutes of Technology.

        <p>Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) are a group of premier public research institutions in India. The institutes were established by the Government of India through the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to provide collegiate education in basic sciences coupled with research at the undergraduate level. The institutes were formally established by the Parliament of India through the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research (Amendment) Act, 2010 (an amendment to the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007).[3][4] Seven IISERs have been established across the country, namely IISER Kolkata in West Bengal, IISER Pune in Maharashtra, IISER Mohali in Punjab, IISER Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, IISER Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, IISER Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, and IISER Berhampur in Odisha.[5][6] All IISERs were declared as Institutes of National Importance by the Parliament of India in 2012,[7] to promote them as leading institutions in the country in the field of basic sciences along with its sister institutes like Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar. The financial outlay for each IISER is around â‚¹5 billion (US$63 million) for the first five years of establishment.
